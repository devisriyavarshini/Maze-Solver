# Maze-Solver

A console-based C++ project that solves a maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Features
- Reads maze from a text file
- Uses BFS to find shortest path
- Prints maze with solution path marked as `*`

## Input Format
- First line: rows cols
- Next lines: maze structure
- `S` = Start, `E` = End, `#` = Wall, ` ` = Free path

## Concepts Used
- Graph traversal (BFS)
- Grid representation
- Path reconstruction using parent pointers
